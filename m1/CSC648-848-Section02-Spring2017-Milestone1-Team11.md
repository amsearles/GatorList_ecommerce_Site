**Team11** solves scaled networking for college students reselling textbooks. Our team unified the core functions of e-commerce platforms into a single, complete architecture. Team11 has launched its Alpha program at **San Francisco State University**.
 **Team11** is built on top of one cutting edge software to provide high speed transactions for users. Our platform will be reliable, secure and customer tested when we go to market. 
 	We believe that existing peer to peer textbook sales platforms do not meet the needs for users and investors. In our platform, schools can work directly to update textbooks requirements for classes at their university using http://sfsuse.com/~sp17g11/_login.
 	A scaled review process for textbook postings in the case of fraud is in place.
 
 **To the seller:** no markup will be placed on your book for using our system. 
 **To the buyer:** reach out to the seller using our secure platform. 
 **To the school:** any book unavailable on our platform can be linked to the campus library/store at a small fee. Signing up for premium membership will qualify you in priority ad spacing.
 	
 	You can learn about our core software engineers at http://sfsuse.com/~sp17g11/about.php
 
 Our team has compiled extensive research and practice implementing the latest design and features into web systems. 
 


## DARYL
>-Well written!
>-What about email confirmation message to get activated after registration. For security purposes. This way Jeremy can not use someone else's email address to register to our website.
>-Same question, are we going to hadnle online transactions? It is a lot of work for Sally and us.
>-Requiring Alexander to upload at least one photo requires us to create a link for users to report if irrelevant picture is uploaded.This arise another complication such as any user can report and spam the system,so should we implement it at Verified(Registered) User level? 
>-WHat about rating system? student who purchased the item should be able to review and rate seller based on accuracy , and ease of reaching out to seller.
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hasan)

1. Jeremy is a student at SFSU with very limited technological skills who is logging on the website for the first time looking to buy a textbook. When first opening the webpage Jeremy is able to see a button prompting him to browse, which he selects. After that Jeremy is able to choose the “textbooks” category from a list of options and all the current items marked as textbooks appear initially sorted alphabetically. Jeremy doesn’t want to spend a lot of money so above the listings he sees the “sort” button and selects “price low to high” and the results are organized by price. Without logging in Jeremy is able to access the descriptions and pictures of items. When he presses the button to begin the transaction he is prompted to either log in to his account or register a new one. As a guest user with no prior account Jeremy must enter an sfsu email along with a password to create his account, as well as agree to our terms and services agreement that addresses all of the permissions the user grants to the site. Jeremy enters an email, which does not contain the sfsu.edu suffix, and upon pressing register is prompted to enter an sfsu email. After the account has been created Jeremy will be redirected to the Item page he was previously viewing, where he may use the messaging system to contact the seller, or use any of the sellers selected contact information where they can discuss price, meeting times, or deliver options. After the transastion Jeremy will be prompted to rate the seller and transaction from one to five stars. If upon recieving the product Jeremy believes that he has been misled by the seller he can contact support and the message will reach a site Admin. The records of their messages through the site will be saved for administrator mediation purposes, using the transaction number as a primary key, as stated in the terms and services agreement.


2. Sally is a skilled Admin of the site who has opened the site and logged into her Admin account and sees a message in the support messages from a user about a dispute that has occured involving the site. After opening the web page Sally clicks the log in button and enters her email and password. The database acknowledges her as an admin and opens her site with admin controls. In order to mediate between the two parties Sally uses the transaction number to find the details of the transaction. From there as an administrator she can find the chat logs between the two users to find the root of the issue. She is able to determine by reading through the chat logs that the seller was being misleading about the quality of the Item. Leaving the Item page Sally is able to find the seller by using his user id number and block his account from making sales, as well as remove the misleading Item page.


3. Alexander is a student at SFSU who has previously used the website to make a purchase and now would like to post his own calculator for sale. Upon opening the site he presses the post button and is prompted to log in or register for an account, as a previously verified user Alexander enters his email and password and is logged in. Alexander enters the name of his Item, selects a category and is forced to upload at least one image of his Item and is able to add up to five total images, here he is also able to leave contact information for those interested in his Item. After he presses the post button on this page the information he entered into the page is added to the Item page where his calculator can be found under the calculator category for purchase. When a verified user wishes to communicate with Alexander about his post he will receive a notification in the messages tab that can be found from a link on the main page.
