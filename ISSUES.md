### Branches
 Please CLONE git to your local branches and commit continously. 
 We will be updating server once in 2 days.

### NOTE: When there is a team, then there is always incidents that one or few members fall behind at certain tasks and you usually we see that they pick up and change the roles .
It is normal to have some people working slow for some period of time. Thats wehere team steps in and covers for that person, next day he will cover one of us for sure. Thus, don't get your 
mood down if you think that you are the one carrying the weight, soon you will find yourself on shoulders of your team mate :) thanks to each and every single of you.

### Note 2: Hin & Daryl, could you please remove or re-organize folders in our main github page (i.e Register Login, navbar..)  I don't want to delete them blindly. And please close those unused branches to simplify.
