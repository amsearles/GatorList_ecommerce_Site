5) Self-check on best practices for security
-	List major assets you are protecting
-	Confirm that you encrypt  PW in the DB
-	Confirm Input data validation (list what is being checked and how) – we recommend  you validate: a) search bar input; b) e-mail in registration to ensure it is sfsu e-mail by checking the string to contain “sgsu.edu”


Major Assets:
•	Username 
•	Password
•	Email Address
•	Integrity of Website ( Only logged in users can post)



Password is encrypted


Data Validation: ON TRACK

-	Will check @mai.sfsu.edu
-	Will check for invalid user input
