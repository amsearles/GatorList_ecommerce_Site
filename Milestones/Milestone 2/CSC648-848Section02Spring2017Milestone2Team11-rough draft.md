# 1. Use Cases V2 
*Either copy use cases from M1 after you incorporated instructors’ feedback or expand use cases as needed. Stick to main use cases and be sure to cover use cases that deal with unique features of your product. All key terms mentioned in use cases must be defined in data definitions section (you can make them bold or italics the first time you mention them, indicating to the reader that this is “reserved/special” item).  Focus is still on WHAT and not HOW.*


# 2. Data Definitions V2
*This should be consistent with Milestone 1 but should be expanded and refined as per feedback. Major data items that comprise of sub-data items have to be defined in full (list all its sub-data items). For each item, explain its usage and (if it applies) how it is created and stored (at high level only). Add items requested by instructors. You must use all the data definitions and names consistently in all documents, including UI text, naming for main variables, classes and database elements etc. Focus on data items unique and important to your application and avoid explaining obvious things like Internet, Browser, Cloud, etc. Be sure to cover all ALL items critical to your project and especially those providing a competitive advantage.*

# 3. Functional Requirements  V2 
*Expand functional requirements from Milestone 1 into Milestone 2, with more details as necessary. Keep the same reference numbers with respect to Milestone 1 (i.e. if high level requirement was number 3 in Milestone 1, then Milestone 2 more detailed requirements are 3.1, 3.2 etc.).  Be sure to cover ALL and especially unique features of your product. OK to add new or delete previous functional requirements from Milestone 1, if you can justify it.*
*Prioritize each requirement/spec with 1, 2, 3. (1-must have; 2 – desired; 3 – opportunistic as defined in the class). To develop these priorities think of the user, use cases, and making your application complete from usability, marketing and business aspects. Base this also on your skills, resources and schedules. Instructors will check final priorities. The priorities you set later in Milestone 3 will constitute your commitment (especially priorities of 1), so be very careful.* 

*In terms of presentation, for easier review the best is to group all requirements first by priority i.e. list Priority 1 requirements first, then Priority 2 etc. and within each priority section you can group them by actors (users, admin)*


# 4.Non-Functional Requirements V2
*Keep them as before. Make sure to define browser versions you will support.*


# 5. UI Mockups and Storyboards (high level only) 
Create mockups/storyboards for all major (only major) use cases (e.g. 4-6 major use cases, each storyboard appr. 1-3 screens). Have ONE mockup per page so we can easily read it comment
Start with black and white wire diagrams focusing on basic layout and description of the functions in each main area of the GUI. Create simple “storyboards” (sequence of mockups) organized by use cases… This helps test the navigation and flow. The format for UI mockups is very flexible: you can use HTML, graphics tools, even hand drawings.   We recommend hand drawings, which you can scan and include in final Milestone 2 document. Do not use graphics or colors yet (unless absolutely necessary), it draws attention from basic UI concepts (functions, behaviors, layouts, flow…).  
Briefly describe behavior of each function using text (user action, output, navigation, error conditions) 
“Test” the above mockups, keeping ease of use and your use cases in mind.  Walk through your mockups as if they are “live” with someone playing the role of user clicking on buttons as per sue cases.
Use data terms and names consistently with Data Dictionary and use cases.
Make sure that the actual display of mockups in the hard copy documents is easy to read
***quick mockup I did.  Not sure if you guys want to show featured items like amazon or ebay does, or show images of different categories like etsy does.***

# 6. High level Architecture, Database Organization 
List main SW products/components used, including those determined by the instructors that you are using as part of the class (e.g. LAMP, server in Amazon Cloud, etc.). . 
Describe the main data organization and high level database schema/organization (high level), e.g. list items in each DB table
Especially for images describe image format/size, thumbnail format, metadata, related data, etc. Same for videos (if applicable). Also describe if images and video/audio will be kept in file systems or in DB BLOBs (decision you must make by the end of M2). Describe any other special data format requirements like for video/audio/GPS etc.
Describe search architecture (if any): what terms will be searched, what is the search algorithm, and how it will be coded and organized in the DB. 
Describe any significant non-trivial algorithm or process (like rating, ranking, automatic prioritizing of items, special services e.g. from Google Maps etc.)
Describe and define at high level any major APIs that you will cerate

# 7. High Level UML Diagrams
Familiarize yourself with Unified Modeling Language (UML). Find your favorite UML tutorials from the Internet. One good one is http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/31863 

At minimum provide:
a) High-level UML class diagrams for implementation classes of core functionality, i.e. functionality with provided interfaces. Focus on a main high-level classes only (one or at most two levels deep). This must reflect an OO approach to implementing your site.

b) UML Component and deployment diagrams

Use data terms and names consistently with Glossary/Data Dictionary

# 8. Key Risks
Identify only actual and specific risks in your current work such as: 
skills risks (do you have the right skills), 
schedule risks (can you make it given what you committed and the resources), 
technical risks (any technical unknowns to solve), 
teamwork risks (any issues related to teamwork); 
legal/content risks (can you obtain content/SW you need legally with proper licensing, copyright). 

Tell us how do you plan to resolve risks? The key is to resolve risks as soon as possible. (Note that we will provide you with basic set of images). Categorizing risk as above helps a lot in managing them

# 9. Team Organization
Outline key roles of team members (as much as you know at this point – 1-2 lines per member).
