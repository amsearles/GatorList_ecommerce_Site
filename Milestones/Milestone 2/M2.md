6. High level Architecture, Database Organization 

-	Describe the main data organization and high level database schema/organization (high level), e.g. list items in each DB table
Schema: Team Eleven Table
Table: Books
Items: Name
-	The Very Hungry Caterpillar

-	Corduroy

Table: Electronics
Items: Name

-	Describe search architecture (if any): what terms will be searched, what is the search algorithm, and how it will be coded and organized in the DB. 

We will be using SQL Percent Like (%_) as our search method.

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

WHERE b.name LIKE 'T%' 	Returns any value in Table Books that starts with T.

WHERE e.name LIKE ‘%ol%’ Returns any value in Table Electronics that has ‘ol’ in any position.
