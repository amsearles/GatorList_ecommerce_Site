Delivery 2: Folder with complete project documentation – “M5 folder”

Please note that we use this final documentation for grading, both its content and format, as per rubrics we published. 

It is the responsibility of the team lead to collect all required documents in one hard copy M5 folder and responsibility of all team members to help. This document/folder has to be delivered just before your demo and it will be used for grading.

Note also that this folder becomes your valuable portfolio that you should use in your job search. So, make copies for everybody in your team. 

The M5 folder is to be given to instructors prior to starting your presentation.

The final M5 folder must have the following content and format (adherence to required format is graded). Failure to follow exact format and content may reduce the team grade.

1) Cover page (placed on the outer page of the folder and inside) containing:
•	Title: “Final Project for SW Engineering Class CSC 648-848 Section M Spring 2017”. (M is section 01 or 02)
•	Team number, 
•	Name of your application (if any), 
•	Names of all members with the team lead first (with team lead’s e-mail), 
•	URL of the demo,
•	Date 

2) Product summary (e.g. how would you market and sell your product). Please copy this section from M4 (it is put here again for completeness of M5)

•	Name of the product
•	Explicit list of ALL major committed functions (your FINAL  P1 functions for which you will be graded) your team shall actually deliver (and test for)  (you should use   plain English and not language used for formal specs, like if you would talk to a customer).This is your FINAL functional commitment
•	What is unique in your product  (optional)
•	URL to your product

Length: max 1 page. Write it for wide audience: executives, marketing, customers. 

The list of final functions will be checked on your final delivery for functionality and correct operation as you specified them. Failure to deliver complete list of these committed functions may result in reduced grade. 

Global teams: Please list P1s developed by you and P1 developed by Fulda students separately. (P1 features of Fulda team listed here will have to be shown integrated with SFSU app and shown in  final demo at SFSU).


3) Milestone documents
M1, M2, M3 feedback summary report, M4 - all frozen versions after feedback was incorporated as specified before. You do not have to revise them based on changes after they were frozen. This way they are kind of “snapshots in time”. Please update the history table of each milestone.


4) Screen Shots of actual final product as shown in the demo
Section title: “Product Screen Shots” contains copies of all final screen shots of your final product (1 or 2 per page).


5) Workbench screen shots of your actual DB (1-2 pages)
Show one screen with user and one with data listing, showing all important DB fields including user PWs


6) Google analytics plot for your WWW site (1 page)



7) Team member contributions
This will be a printout of e-mails that each team member sends to ALL of their respective team members  (so that all team members can see all the mail on this) outlining:
a)	His/her contributions to team project and teamwork (technical and any other) in no more than half a page – point format is OK. 
b)	Number of submissions he/she made to github team dev. branch

Length of e-mail is ¾ page max. This is kind of “peer review” – this makes sure you are comfortable with what you have done since all other team members will see it. Team leads and CTOs: mention your role as team leads/CTO. 

NOTE: You must submit hard copies of raw (original) e-mails sent from each team member to all other team members including e-mail address lines, and not the summary done by team lead.


8) In two-three  paragraphs, max ½ page outline (we suggest team lead does it):
•	Main challenges you faced and how you resolved them
•	What would you have done better in order to avoid them in the future
